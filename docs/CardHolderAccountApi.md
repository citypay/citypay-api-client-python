# **account_retrieve_request**
> CardHolderAccount account_retrieve_request(accountid)

Account Retrieval

Allows for the retrieval of a card holder account for the given `id`. Should duplicate accounts exist for the same `id`, the first account created with that `id` will be returned.  The account can be used for tokenisation processing by listing all cards assigned to the account. The returned cards will include all `active`, `inactive` and `expired` cards. This can be used to  enable a card holder to view their wallet and make constructive choices on which card to use. 

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (cp-api-key):

```python
import time
import citypay
from citypay.api import card_holder_account_api
from citypay.model.error import Error
from citypay.model.card_holder_account import CardHolderAccount
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.citypay.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = citypay.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.citypay.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: cp-api-key
configuration.api_key['cp-api-key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['cp-api-key'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with citypay.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = card_holder_account_api.CardHolderAccountApi(api_client)
    accountid = "accountid_example" # str | The account id that refers to the customer's account no. This value will have been provided when setting up the card holder account.

    # example passing only required values which don't have defaults set
    try:
        # Account Retrieval
        api_response = api_instance.account_retrieve_request(accountid)

# **charge_request**
> Decision charge_request(charge_request)

Charge

A charge process obtains an authorisation using a tokenised value which represents a stored card  on a card holder account.  A card must previously be registered by calling `/account-register-card` with the card details  or retrieved using `/account-retrieve`  Tokens are generated whenever a previously registered list of cards are retrieved. Each token has, by design a  relatively short time to live of 30 minutes. This is both to safe guard the merchant and card holder from  replay attacks. Tokens are also restricted to your account, preventing malicious actors from stealing details for use elsewhere.    If a token is reused after it has expired it will be rejected and a new token will be required.   Tokenisation can be used for   - repeat authorisations on a previously stored card - easy authorisations just requiring CSC values to be entered - can be used for credential on file style payments - can require full 3-D Secure authentication to retain the liability shift - wallet style usage    _Should an account be used with 3DSv2, the card holder name should also be stored alongside the card as this is a required field with both Visa and MasterCard for risk analysis._.
