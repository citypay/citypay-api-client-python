# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ProcessBatchRequest from a JSON string
process_batch_request_instance = ProcessBatchRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(ProcessBatchRequest.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
process_batch_request_dict = process_batch_request_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of ProcessBatchRequest from a dict
process_batch_request_from_dict = ProcessBatchRequest.from_dict(process_batch_request_dict)
