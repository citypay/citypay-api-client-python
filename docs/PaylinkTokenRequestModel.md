## Example

```python
from citypay.models.paylink_token_request_model import PaylinkTokenRequestModel

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of PaylinkTokenRequestModel from a JSON string
paylink_token_request_model_instance = PaylinkTokenRequestModel.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(PaylinkTokenRequestModel.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
paylink_token_request_model_dict = paylink_token_request_model_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of PaylinkTokenRequestModel from a dict
